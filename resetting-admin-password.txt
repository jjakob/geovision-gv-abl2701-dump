Open the camera by removing the 4 screws on the front (Torx TX 8).

Attach a 3.3V (important!) USB TTL serial adapter to the pins on the board as shown below:

pinout: camera | USB-serial
1 - GND | GND
2 - RX | TX
3 - TX | RX
4 - 3.3V | NC (do not connect!)

Open a terminal program on your PC (it should support VT terminal emulation) and open the USB serial port with 115200 8n1. On Unix or GNU/Linux you can use screen: `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`.
Now connect the camera to power (PoE or 12V DC). You should see boot messages start scrolling on your terminal. If you get nothing, recheck your terminal speed and settings. If you don't even get any blinking on the USB adapter activity LEDs, double check your wires to the camera.

Now wait until the messages stop coming, and press enter. You'll see a login prompt.
Login with user "root", password "123456" (if that doesn't work try the password "helpme").
You'll be dropped to a custom shell (not a standard Unix shell).
Now type "resetconfig" and press enter. Voila, the device will reboot and the admin password is reset to "admin".
In the process of rebooting, the current IP settings will be printed, in case you don't know the static IP, you can catch it here. There may be a way to reset the IP settings via one of the other commands available on the shell (type "help" for a list).

You can now try logging in via the HTTP admin. If it works, you can power down the camera, unplug the USB adapter, remove the wires and reassemble the camera.
